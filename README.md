#Jenkins Sonar integration demo
This is a simple project for the blog post on pydyniak.com (english version) and pydyniak.pl (polish version) which explains how to use Jenkins and Sonar for continious code quality inspection.

Even though it contains only few classes it's written badly (in terms of code quality) and that's on purpose in order to show how Sonar shows code errors
